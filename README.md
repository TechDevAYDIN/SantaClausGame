# SantaClausGame

This project is the last one I published last year. It is a game prototype that I made for an advertising test and the idea belongs me. This project is not fully optimized and polished, as I had to finish it in a short time. Therefore, some bugs and glitches may occur during the gameplay. Also, some of the models I used are paid assets, so I only shared the script files on GitHub.
